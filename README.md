# RobustAFT: Robust Estimation of AFT Model with High-dimensional Covariates

A unified Expectation-Maximization approach combined with the L1-norm (or sparse group lasso) penalty to perform variable selection and obtain parameter estimation simultaneously for the accelerated failure time model with right-censored survival data.
